# Integer Linear Program Solver

This repository contains a C implementation of a **linear programming solver** for integer coefficients. Unlike traditional methods, this solver takes an optimized approach, aiming to solve integer linear programs (ILP) more efficiently by avoiding an explicit two-pass simplex algorithm. 

## Features

- **Integer Linear Programming**: Solves linear programs with integer constraints directly.
- **Optimized Algorithm**: Avoids the conventional two-pass simplex method for faster computation.
- **High Efficiency**: Algorithm designed to reduce computational steps and enhance runtime, making it suitable for larger problems with integer constraints.
